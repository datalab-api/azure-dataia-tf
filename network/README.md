# Azure Resource Network Deployment with Terraform

This README provides an overview of the Terraform code designed for deploying resources to Azure.

## Resources Created

1. **Resource Group (`azurerm_resource_group`):** 
    - Creates a container for all Azure resources within this deployment.

2. **Storage Account (`azurerm_storage_account`):** 
    - Sets up a storage account for durable data storage.

3. **Virtual Network (`azurerm_virtual_network`):** 
    - Establishes a private network for secure communication among Azure resources.

4. **Subnet(s) (`azurerm_subnet`):** 
    - Segments resources within the virtual network.

5. **Public IP Address (`azurerm_public_ip`):** 
    - Provides a static public IP for outbound internet access (optional).

6. **Network Security Group (`azurerm_network_security_group`):** 
    - Defines security rules to manage inbound and outbound traffic for resources.

7. **Network Interface (`azurerm_network_interface`):** 
    - Connects a VM to the virtual network and optionally assigns a public IP address.

## Important Notes

- Utilizes variables for configuration details such as resource names and location. These variables should be defined in a separate `.tfvars` file.
- Includes comments throughout the code for explaining the purpose of specific resources and arguments.
- The security rule definition uses a dynamic block to accommodate multiple rules with varying configurations.
- The network interface references the public IP address and network security group by their IDs.

## Getting Started

1. Configure your Azure credentials and Terraform provider.
2. Define the required variables in a separate `.tfvars` file.
3. Run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform workspace.
4. Execute `terraform plan` to preview the changes that will be made.
5. Execute `terraform apply` to create the resources in Azure.
